Repository for a Primary school app

## Building the Android app

You need to download the Parse.com Android library and put it into the `Android/Sebastiaanschool/libs/` directory. Same for the [Espresso Standalone][esp] library.

Your Parse.com credentials are merged into the Android app by means of a `ParseConfig.java` generated alongside `BuildConfig.java`.
